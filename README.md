# C# / .NET Examples

The samples in this repo go along with my blog posts that relate to specific [versions of C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history) and the .NET Framework (which are [very closely related](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/relationships-between-language-and-library) and usually updated at the same time, as shown [here](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/Language-Version-History.md) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Versions)). I occasionally host shorter snippets on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/grantwinney) or [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/grantwinney/fiddles/) and embed those into posts too.

The list below has links to each blog post, as well as a direct link to the relevant code for each post, separated by version of language/framework. If you're interested in seeing some of these applied specifically to WinForms, check out my [Surviving WinForms](https://github.com/grantwinney/Surviving-WinForms) repo.
