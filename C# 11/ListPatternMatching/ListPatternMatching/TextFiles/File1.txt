Title: Address to the Nation on the Challenger
Date: 1/28/1986

We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that.
We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun.
We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.

And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff.
I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.
It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them......

The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives.
We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye
and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'
